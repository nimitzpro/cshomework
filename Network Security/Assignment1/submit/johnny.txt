I PUT THE SHOTGUN IN AN ADIDAS BAG AND PADDED IT OUT WITH FOUR PAIRS OF TENNIS SOCKS, NOT MY STYLE AT ALL, BUT THAT WAS WHAT I WAS AIMING FOR: IF THEY THINK YOU'RE CRUDE, GO TECHNICAL; IF
THEY THINK YOU'RE TECHNICAL, GO CRUDE. I'M A VERY TECHNICAL BOY. SO I DECIDED TO GET AS CRUDE
AS POSSIBLE. THESE DAYS, THOUGHT, YOU HAVE TO BE PRETTY TECHNICAL BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN ASPIRE TO CRUDENESS. I'D HAD TO TURN BOTH THOSE TWELVE-GAUGE SHELLS FROM BRASS STOCK, ON THE LATHE, AND THEN LOAD THEN MYSELF; I'D HAD TO DIG UP AN OLD MICROFICHE WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR HAND- LOADING CARTRIDGES; I'D HAD TO BUILD A LEVER-ACTION PRESS TO SEAT THE PRIMERS -ALL VERY TRICKY. BUT I KNEW THEY'D WORK. THE MEET WAS SET FOR THE DROME AT 2300, BUT I RODE THE TUBE THREE STOPS PAST THE CLOSEST PLATFORM AND WALKED BACK. IMMACULATE PROCEDURE. JOHNNY MNEMONIC - WILLIAM GIBSON
