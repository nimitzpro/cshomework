A. Client connects to the server using the IP and port number to connect to the socket, 
and persists a connection, waiting for the user on the client side to type in a message.
Once a message is entered, it is sent to the server.

B. The message sent by the client is added to the log file

C. No, because only the server writes to a log file

D. It is not possible with my implementation, but I believe it is possible by expanding the server code

E. We need the client to keep running so that multiple messages can be sent and so that messages from the server can be received, 
which would not be possible if the client had terminated
